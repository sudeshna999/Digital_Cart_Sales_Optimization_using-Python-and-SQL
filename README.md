Digital Cart: Sales Optimization using Python and SQL

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing e-commerce sales using Python and SQL. The objective is to clean and analyze sales data, identify seasonal trends, and understand customer behavior to provide data-driven recommendations for improving product performance and sales strategies.

🚀 Features

🛒 Sales Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in e-commerce sales data.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified seasonal trends, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue drivers.

🔄 SQL Data Manipulation: Queried and aggregated large datasets for meaningful insights.

📈 Trend Analysis: Uncovered sales patterns across different time periods.

📢 Actionable Recommendations: Suggested strategies to boost sales and optimize product performance.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy) - For data analysis and visualization.

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite) - For querying and managing sales data.

Jupyter Notebook - For running and documenting the analysis.

📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection: Retrieved e-commerce sales data from databases and CSV files.

Data Cleaning: Used Pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data correctly.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated summary statistics and visualized key trends.

SQL Queries: Extracted insights on customer segments, product sales, and seasonal demand.

Insight Generation: Interpreted patterns and formulated recommendations.

Reporting: Summarized findings through visual dashboards and reports.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Some key questions explored in this project:

What are the peak sales seasons?

Which products generate the highest revenue?

How does customer behavior vary across different time periods?

🔢 Data Analysis

Example SQL query used in the project:

SELECT product_category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

🔥 Insights & Impact
